# Rent All

## Project 3

## User Story
1. User vists the site and is redirected to the login/register page
2. With their account activated users are bought to the '/map' page.
3. From here the user can select a state to render a map of all zip codes in the state. Users can zoom and drag the map to find the zip code they'd like to learn more about. Clicking on the zip code will bring up the information. Alternately, users can use the search bar in the nav bar or on the '/map' page to search for a zip code.
4. On the view page users can select what kind of property data they'd like to see for the given zip code. The data will be graphed as a linechart with dynamic tooltips that provide more specific information.

## Technologies Used
-Sinatra

-Angular 4
-D3
-Quandl API
-HTML5, CSS

## What is Unfinished
In its current state the app is fully functional, however, there are a variety of changes that would make it more fun/pleasant to use. Primarily, we'd like to add the ability to compare zip codes against each other, or see how property prices in a given zip compare to the area surrounding them. Additionally, we'd like to build out user functionality so that users can 'save' certain zip codes and more easily track them. Finally, we'd like to explore adding the topoJSON map files to our own database to see if this reduces the load time of the maps.

## Incoming Small Tweaks
-Some of the graphs are crowded with too many datapoints, we'd like to make these graphs more readable.
-Additional styling changes
-Additional table view to enable users to delve deeper than the graph
